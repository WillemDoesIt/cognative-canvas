# This is a way to securely write anything
This is my first real attempt at making an app anyone could use and may wish to use.
The app will work like a private discord server. you can create channels, and write anything into them, and every new message has a timecode.
start with a `/help` command to get started and be sure you close the terminal with `/quit` !
